# AI Resume & Cover Letter Generator

<img src="./assets/resume.webp" alt="AI Resume & Cover Letter Generator" width="500">

## Context

This project demonstrates the implementation of an AI-powered resume and cover letter generator. It combines Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to generate professional, ATS-optimized resumes and job-specific cover letters. The system also includes an HR Agent Evaluation module, which assesses resume-job fit and suggests improvements based on AI insights.

In this project, you'll learn how to build an AI-driven job application assistant step by step with the guidance of modern NLP techniques.

## Real World Application

This project tackles a major challenge in job hunting: creating optimized, tailored resumes and cover letters quickly and effectively. The techniques used here are similar to those in:

**Recruitment & Career Services:**

- LinkedIn's AI-generated job application tools
- Resume optimization tools like Zety and Enhancv
- Career coaching services using AI-powered insights

**Human Resources & Hiring Platforms:**

- Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) that screen resumes
- AI-driven job recommendation platforms
- Resume screening software used by recruiters

**Generative AI & NLP Applications:**

- AI-powered text generation for professional documents
- Context-aware personalization of application materials
- Keyword optimization for better job match rates

**The AI Resume and Cover Letter Generator helps job seekers:**

- Save time by automating repetitive tasks
- Optimize resumes for ATS screening to improve job prospects
- Receive personalized feedback on how well their resume matches a job description

These skills are increasingly valuable as AI-driven hiring becomes standard in the job market.

## Learning Approach

This project is designed as an interactive learning experience, where you'll work with AI tools to understand and implement each feature. Rather than just following a pre-built template, you'll learn the core concepts behind resume optimization, AI text generation, and job-market insights.

## Project Overview

The application will provide:

- A Resume Generator that guides users through structured input forms.

- An HR Agent Evaluation Module that compares resumes to job descriptions and suggests improvements.

- A Cover Letter Generator that creates job-specific, personalized cover letters.

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: ReactJS (for user-friendly UI)

- Backend: ExpressJS or Django (to handle data processing)

- Database: PostgreSQL (for storing user resumes and job comparisons)

- AI Integration: OpenAI API (for resume and cover letter generation)

## Dataset

This project can use publicly available job description datasets or synthetic resume datasets to fine-tune job-resume matching models. You can start with datasets from:

- Kaggle's Resume & Job Description Datasets

- Open-source ATS resume samples

## Initial Setup Requirements

1. Tools/Accounts Needed:

- Node.js and npm
- PostgreSQL (for storing resume/job evaluation data)
- OpenAI API key (for AI-powered text generation)
- Code editor (VS Code recommended)
- Git (for version control)

2. Recommended Knowledge:

- Basic React (for frontend development)
- Basic Express/Django (for backend APIs)
- Basic PostgreSQL (for data persistence)
- REST APIs (to connect frontend and backend)

## Tiers

This project is designed to be built in 3 tiers, with each tier expanding on the previous one:

Tier 1: Core resume and cover letter generation.

Tier 2: ATS optimization and job-specific keyword enhancements.

Tier 3: AI-powered job matching and advanced HR agent evaluation.
